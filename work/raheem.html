                    <div class='who-text'>Police interactions have been in the news a lot lately and, in many cases, the stories are far from uplifting. This problem is often categorized as “isolated,” “just a few officers,” etc., but it seems to be more widespread than that.
                        For the interactions that do not go viral (and even for those that do), reporting the interaction is difficult, time consuming, and sometimes traumatic for the citizen. Raheem aims to humanize this reporting process, encourage
                        more people to submit reports, and aggregate the data into a usable dashboard for citizens and city officials.
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-subheading">02 - Introducing Raheem</div>
                    <div class='who-text'>Raheem is a Facebook Messenger bot for reporting and reviewing police interactions. Through simple conversation, he get information on what happened, where it happened, how you felt, who the officers were, and more. The purpose is
                        to humanize the reporting process and to make people feel safe and comfortable while submitting their reports. Once submitted, data will be aggregated into a dashboard that both citizens and public officials can use to observe
                        the police climate in a given area.

                    <div class='who-text'>Originally, Raheem was a simple webform. The form was effective, but also cold, time consuming, and did not adapt to the user’s situation. We explored many platforms, but settled on a messenger bot for three reasons: the low barrier
                        to entry, the humanized interface, and the ability to create a reactive conversation.

                      <div class='who-text'>
                        <i>A Low Barrier to Entry</i><br /> Millions of people are on Facebook now, and a majority of those users also utilize Facebook Messenger on a daily basis. Given this, it is significantly more likely that someone will engage with
                        Raheem through a simple message – involving no additional downloads or effort – than that someone will download an app or go to our website. Messenger bots and conversational UIs are still in their infancy, so we absolutely are
                        taking a leap of faith here, but we believe it will pay off.
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>A Humanized Interface</i><br />
                        Talking to Raheem is like talking to a friend. He is encouraging, supportive, and respectful while asking about your interactions. We specifically designed the tone of the bot to be colloquial and informal to give users a sense of safety and familiarity. Through our earlier user testing, we found there is a massive difference between, “What happened?” and “Please describe the details of your encounter.”
                        <br /><br />
                        <i>A Reactive Conversation</i><br />
                        Raheem is smart. Really smart. As users navigate the conversation, he can determine if the interaction went positively or negatively and asks follow-up questions accordingly. This nature adds to the humanization of the interface: not only is Raheem talking to you, but he’s listening to you as well.

In the first few weeks, the beta has already given us amazing insight into how real people react to Raheem and what bottlenecks, bugs, and problems exist in the conversation. In the coming months, we plan to launch Raheem publicly, starting with a few university partnerships and expanding out from there.
